🎯 Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

This is a Python-based attendance system using face recognition through OpenCV. It captures real-time facial data via webcam, recognizes faces using a trained model, and logs attendance with timestamp into a CSV file. A GUI built with Tkinter is included for ease of use.

📌 Features

📸 Real-time face detection and recognition

🧠 Model training using Haar Cascade and LBPH

🗃️ Attendance logged in .csv file with date and time

💻 Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter

🧾 Dataset creation and model trainer

📦 Uses pickle for saving label encodings

🧠 Tech Stack

OpenCV – For real-time face recognition

Tkinter – For GUI
